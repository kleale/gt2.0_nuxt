              <h1>Pure~ reveals his is "not in CIS" amidst rumors of him joining Tundra</h1>
              <p>GT (game-tournaments.com) â€“ eSports project about the most popular PC games. At this point of time Dota 2 and CS:GO are the main verticals presented on the site. Other games should be coming soon.</p>
              <div class="badge badge-lg badge-neutral">January 09, 16:31</div>

              <p><a href="/en/dota-2/team/betboom">BetBoom Team</a> inactive carry <a href="/en/dota-2/player/pure-ru">Ivan "Pure~" Moskalenko</a> mentioned he would play for a non-EEU Dota 2 team next season. On a recent stream, he said he "is not in CIS, of course." It sounded like a deliberate mistake to hype up his transfer, but could be a slip of the tongue as well.</p>

                <p>Who are the strongest CIS players? Guys, name me the strongest players in the CIS aside from <a href="/en/dota-2/team/spirit">Spirit</a>. <a href="/en/dota-2/player/dyrachyo">Dyrachyo</a> is the first one, he's right on the spot. Then me, of course. Well, I'm no longer in the CIS, of course... Oh, shit... Then Gleb [<a href="/en/dota-2/player/depressed-kid">Kiyotaka</a>], Romanych [<a href="/en/dota-2/player/ramzes">RAMZES</a>], Vetal [<a href="/en/dota-2/player/save">Save-</a>], everyone is there. And everyone is ranked 500, and I'm ranked 100. And now, I'll turn off the stream so that there is no VOD left.</p>

              <p>Rumor has it Pure~ might end up in <a href="/en/dota-2/team/tundra">Tundra Esports</a>, initially reported by the editor of Metaratings.ru. On January 8, Tundra revealed <a href="/en/dota-2/player/mind-control">MinD_ContRoL</a>'s addition. If the information about the Russian turns out true, he will play in his original carry role.</p>
              <p>Pure~ spent most of last year in offlane, as they swapped positions with <a href="/en/dota-2/player/epileptick1d">Nightfall</a> after <a href="/en/dota-2/dpc-2023-major-2">Berlin Major.</a> He went inactive on December 24. The official reason was to take care of his health and have a break from professional Dota. BetBoom Team hasn't revealed his replacement yet.</p>
